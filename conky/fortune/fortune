He who is making progress, having learned from the philosophers that desire is for good things
and avoidance is toward bad things, and having also learned that impassivity and a good flow of
life are not otherwise attained than through unerring desire and unfailing avoidance - such a person
has removed desire from himself altogether or else deferred it to another time, and exercises avoidance
only toward things within the sphere of choice. For if he tries to avoid anything outside the sphere
of choice, he knows that sooner or later he will stumble onto something contrary to his aversion, and
come to grief.
-- Epictetus, Discourses Book I
